I am a Geospatial Analytics PhD student in the [SEAL](https://ncsu-seal.netlify.app/) lab at NCSU. My current research interests focus on using remote sensing to locate and characterize land surface changes across regional to global scales in near-real time. I am also interested in developing methods to better map short-term inundation changes through time and their subsequent impact on biogeochemical processes related to carbon storage and methane emissions. More broadly, I have an interest in remote sensing applications of machine learning, data assimilation and fusion, time series techniques, and Bayesian statistics.
