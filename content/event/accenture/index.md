summary: Invited guest speakers for a computer vision lunch series put on by Accenture Federal Services.
abstract: 'During this seminar, guest speakers from NCSU, Owen Smith, Laura Wendelberger, and Jenna Abrahamson, will join us to present on their computer vision work. They work alongside our AFS colleagues to support projects within the Applied Research Group. This presentation will be split between three focus areas. Laura will talk about using computer vision techniques for identification of "interesting" images from a large database of 3D simulation results. Owen will focus on the use of texture information within remote sensing to create spatially aware algorithms. Jenna will discuss how clustering techniques can be applied to time series of images for further refinement of detected change regions.'
