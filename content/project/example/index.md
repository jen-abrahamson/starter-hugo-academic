**Quantifying the Ephemeral: a Novel Approach to Estimating Methane Emissions of Short-Term Inundation via Satellite Remote Sensing**
&nbsp;

Biogeochemical processes are strongly influenced by hydrology, particularly in low-lying coastal wetlands where drastic changes in inundated and hydrologically connected areas occur over short time scales.  Wetlands are known to be hotspots of methane (CH4) emissions, with inundation acting as an “on/off” switch for CH4 production.  When soils are saturated, oxygen becomes limited and turns the switch “on'' for methanogenesis to occur as organic matter decomposes and releases CH4 into the atmosphere. Small, seasonally flooded wetlands (<1 hectare) account for a large portion of this type of CH4 production; however, the inability to map these wetlands over short time scales has resulted in an underestimation of total methane emissions. To address this knowledge gap, this project proposes to map daily inundation at high spatial resolution by integrating multi-sensor remotely sensed and process-based models in a model-data assimilation framework to improve methane flux estimates.
