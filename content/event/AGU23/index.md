location: San Francisco, California


summary: Poster presentation on integrating remote sensing and hydrologic modeling to monitor inundation.
abstract: 'The biogeochemistry of wetland ecosystems is driven by the presence and absence of water. Wetlands are vital to carbon sequestration and are known hotspots of methane (CH4) emissions, particularly when inundated. Small ponds and wetlands are thought to account for a large portion of CH4 production with changes in inundation occurring at daily to weekly time scales. Monitoring these short-term, and possibly small-scale changes is therefore critical to quantifying coastal, and even global, CH4 emissions. Remote sensing is the only method capable of monitoring these changes at the regional scale; however, no single remote sensing product has the spatial and temporal resolutions required to map ephemeral inundation extents accurately. To address this, we developed a method to generate high spatiotemporal resolution inundation maps using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery supplemented with commercial PlanetScope imagery to monitor inundation from 2017-2022. A machine learning classifier was trained for each sensor to classify inundation based on a suite of spectral signals and terrain-derived features. Next, predictions from each sensor were integrated using statistical methods that weight each sensor by their respective uncertainties. The models were tested in three wetland-dominated study sites: the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (ARNWR) in North Carolina, the Atchafalaya Delta in Louisiana, and the Everglades in Florida. In-situ ground truth data were used to assess the accuracy of inundation predictions and optimize sensor integration. Our predictions were also compared to the Landsat Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DWSE) product with preliminary results suggesting that coarser-scale products underestimate inundation by missing short-term and small-scale inundation. The results from the ARNWR site were also compared to inundation predictions from PIHM-Wetland, a physically-based hydrologic model, to quantify potential surface obstruction by clouds and vegetation. Overall, existing satellite products often underestimate inundation, and thus, contribute to discrepancies in estimated emissions. By using multiple sensors, this work investigates how best to monitor inundation at high spatiotemporal resolution in order to develop more accurate climate models for a changing future.'
