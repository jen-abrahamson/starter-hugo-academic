### Evaluating the Influence of Environmental Variables on Discrepancies Between Flux Tower Metrics and Satellite-Derived Land Surface Temperature
&nbsp;
    Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a critical parameter associated with the surface energy and water balance of the land-atmosphere system, with wide application in environmental studies, policy development, and social sciences. While satellite-derived LST offers extensive spatial and temporal coverage, challenges remain in aligning it with in-situ measurements from eddy covariance flux towers. This research (i) evaluates the agreement between Landsat-derived LST and flux tower measurements at 44 sites across the continental United States, (ii) analyzes the influence of environmental conditions and land cover heterogeneity across 9 biomes on LST comparisons, and (iii) examines discrepancies related to seasonal and monthly atmospheric moisture variations, vertical moisture distribution, and dynamic vegetation characteristics.
