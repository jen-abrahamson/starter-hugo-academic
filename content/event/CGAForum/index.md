summary: Presented on Satellite Change Detection for the Center for Geospatial Analytics Graduate Student Forum.
abstract: 'Monitoring land cover change is crucial for timely detection of deforestation and other anthropogenic activities relevant to climate change and intelligence. Bayesian statistical methods are powerful for change detection because they can detect change without relying on long, stable periods of data to train on. However, applying such algorithms in near-real time across the globe while maintaining high levels of accuracy and computational efficiency is challenging. Our work highlights the application of roboBayes, a novel change detection algorithm that enables the broad-area search of multi-source satellite imagery to detect, monitor, and characterize the progression of heavy construction events across Earth.'
