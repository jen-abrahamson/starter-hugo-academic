**Variable Inundation across Earth's Terrestrial Ecosystems**
&nbsp;

Project focused on developing strategies to optimize the characterization and prediction of variably inundated ecosystems (VIEs) across scales,ranging from local to global. This effort includes retrieving and consolidating information on remote sensing, modeling, and direct measurement of VIEs of all types across space and time. This is the project I worked on during my time as an intern at Pacific Northwest National lab.
