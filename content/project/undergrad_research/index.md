### Fluvial Geomorphology
&nbsp;
      For over 2.5 years, I conducted fluvial geomorphology research in southwestern Norway that focused on analyzing rivers and watersheds to answer the question of whether active fault rejuvenation was taking place within the region. This project, under the direction of Dr. Jeni McDermott, utilized computational methods of analysis that involved GIS, Matlab programming, and Google Earth, which ultimately supplemented a field season in Norway. For this project, I wrote three different grant proposals that were successfully funded by the University of St. Thomas Grants and Research Office and funded me throughout my entire time as a research assistant. I also contributed to developing a new method for locating areas of river capture and drainage reorganization utilizing ArcGIS and Matlab which I presented at the Geological Society of Americaâ€™s 2017 Annual Meeting in Seattle, Washington.
